# Weekend_Challenge_5

###Description

In this challenge, you will be creating a Pet Application that allows a user to create Pets that are stored in a database. Then, in another view, the user can see the list of pets.

You will need three views:

Home view - Nothing special, just greeting the user, giving them direction on how to use the application,

Add view - This page will allow the user to add a new pet with a form,

Pets view - Meaning that the user can see a list of the entered pets.

You will use the full MEAN stack for this (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node)

Each Pet will need to have the following information: - Name (example, Grilled Cheese) - Animal (example, Cat), - Age (example, 14) - Image Url
